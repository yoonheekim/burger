# Burger
* Portfolio : https://yoonheekim.github.io/YoonPortfolio/
* Heroku : https://burger-yh.herokuapp.com/

## Overviews
1. Burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM
2. Restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
3. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
4. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
5. Your app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Technologies
> Node.js, Github, Heroku, npm packages(express, express-handlebars, mysql), html, javascript, Jquery, Bootstrap

## Problems
* It was hard to deploy to both of Heroku and Github because it was first time to deploy the project using DB.
